Prolog program to solve the cracker barrel peg game

To run this program:
1. run `swipl` to open prolog interpreter
2. run `[cracker].` to load cracker.pl program
3. run `go().` to show the moves to solve the peg game

KNOWN ISSUE: On the last iteration of the `go` loop, the board prints in an infinite loop.
I'm not entirely sure why, hence it is still in the submitted program.
